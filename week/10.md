## *Harmonic Collection* review

Letâ€™s pick back up with your entries:

[*Harmonic Collection* entries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vXYVnicRUHnczxPCSaqsmmflynnwP22zhES5jFMPKpw/)
{: .icon-link .two-below }

*Would love to hear from folks who tried Jekyll.*

{% comment %}
* Note lack of progression, lot of copy-pasting-into previous.
* Not all responsive, lots of breaks at 375. Try them in phones!
* Call on Vanessa, Chris, Amanda, Samarth.

Make goog doc for questions, start it off.
Inspirational siteâ€”how this is done.
Image containers/sizing, object-fit.

## Some more, *advanced* CSS

Before we leave CSS, IÂ wanted to go through some loose-end/remainder things we didnâ€™t getÂ to:

[Additional, advancedÂ CSS](/topic/advanced-css)
{: .icon-link }

(I think weâ€™ll finally get into JS, next week.)



> Weâ€™ll take a break somewhere in here, midway through.
{: .callout icon='ðŸ˜²'}



## Quick demo, maybe

I want to go through the CSS stuff pretty thoroughly today, but if we have time weâ€™ll pick up from our demo [last week](/week/9/#lets-try-it-out):

- Go through structured data (third entry, show `for` loop)
- Add an empty/new entry
- See where folks are at with Jekyll

## For next week

- Review the [CSS grab-bag](/topic/advanced-css) from today. Iâ€™dÂ like to start seeing this in your work, particularly the typographic refinements!

- Complete an eighth entry for your [*HarmonicÂ Collection*](/project/harmonic) projects and add it to the doc:

	[*Harmonic Collection* entries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vXYVnicRUHnczxPCSaqsmmflynnwP22zhES5jFMPKpw/)
	{: .icon-link}
