## Testing responsive design



The easiest way to test all these things out is using [the device mode](https://www.notion.so/DevTools-The-Inspector-d0533c0133b24b168160eee046ce94b9) in Chromeâ€™s *Inspector*. There will still be differences (like not necessarily honoring device-specific settings like `hover`), but for layout/breakpoint development it is often much faster than checking on actual devices!
