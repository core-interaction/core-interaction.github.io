This course teaches students intermediate and advanced methods in typography and interactive design to successfully meet the ever changing challenges of designing and prototyping successful products and services for screens. These comprehensive methods will also support students to complete their projects in other studio classes. Students will learn how to address design problems meaningfully within the context of current design practices, while working towards developing an individualized working methodology. Students will also become familiar with the process of transforming an idea into a functional design by making use of basic web technologies. They will use their newly acquired design vocabulary to critique and critically discuss work produced by themselves and others.
