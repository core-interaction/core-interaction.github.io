## Reading discussion

Letâ€™s talk through our last reading:

[*The Webâ€™s Grain* responses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pn5Hcw9hXk6U6rb6ccFG1ROD6i-EfcSXlm8PX6Kcm9M/edit)
{: .icon-link .two-below }

*Again, Iâ€™d like this to be a discussion and I want to hear from folksÂ who havenâ€™t participated yet. (In the interest of time, Iâ€™ll beÂ looking at this weekâ€™s [projectÂ entries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vXYVnicRUHnczxPCSaqsmmflynnwP22zhES5jFMPKpw/) outside of class.)*



## Responsive design!

Todayâ€™s topic is *responsive design*, which hinges on the use ofÂ *mediaÂ queries*:

[Media queries](/topic/responsive)
{: .icon-link }



> We will break somewhere midway through the lecture, again.
{: .callout icon='ðŸ˜´'}



## Working responsively

As a sort of demo/exercise today, weâ€™re going to look at how to work on a responsive page with the *DevTools*:

[DevTools (The Inspector)](/topic/inspector)
{: .icon-link }




------------



## For next week

- Read through the whole [media query](/topic/responsive) lecture above, as isÂ custom. Our project entries from now on should be responsive!

  *I expect to see media queries used, going forward. Letâ€™s primarily focus on mobile and laptopâ€”I will be looking at ~Â `375px` and ~Â `1280px`.*

- Complete a responsive fourth entry for your [*HarmonicÂ Collection*](/project/harmonic) projects and add it to the doc:
