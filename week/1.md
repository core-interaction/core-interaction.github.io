## Introductions



* First, tell us a bit about yourself

  *Your preferred name, your pronouns, maybe where you’re from, something your classmates might not know about you, one thing you want us to know?*

* Next, tell us about your path as a designer

  *How did you become interested in design, what are you hoping to get out of this course (or out of this program)?*

* Last, tell us (mainly me) about your technical side

  *How comfortable are you in code, have you put together a website before, what have been your challenges?*

## Why is this important

We’re going to talk about the web, and why it will be our pathway into design and code.

* Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you don’t have one! Do this with your *newschool.edu* email, then apply for the [student benefits](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/student_application).
You may use this GitHub account in your career, and you can always change your username (and add other email addresses) later. We’ll be using GitHub for our code.

* Before we get into code, we’re going to read about it:

  This is definitely *Not Short*, so please leave yourself enough time to get all the way through it. And then add your responses—which we will discuss, as a group, next class:

* Finally, come to class with *three* thematic ideas for your [*Harmonic Collection*](/project/harmonic) projects. We’ll be starting on them next week.
