## Reading discussion

Let’s talk through our reading.

## And now, HTML

## Let’s write some code!

We’re going to dive right in and make our first web pages, no big deal! We’ll do this all together.

1. You’ll need to download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), which we’ll use as our text editor for the course.

    You’ll hear me refer to this as an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), for *Integrated Development Environment* (if you remember our reading). Think of this as a fancy text editor with coding-specific features, like syntax highlighting and tabs. There are many of them! *VS Code* is probably the most popular, right now. (It is made by Microsoft. Developers! Developers! Developers!)

1. Also download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), which we’ll use to manage our code. Sign in there with your GitHub account (which you should have already created).

    You might also remember Ford mentioning [Git](https://git-scm.com), a version control software, which tracks changes and helps developers work together. [Git*Hub*](https://github.com) is a widely-used, web-based host for Git projects—known as *repositories*. You can do this all via the command line (and even right from VS Code), but I think we’ll use their *Desktop* app for now. (This is now also owned by Microsoft.)

1. [Create a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop) for your *Harmonic Collection* entries. Think of this as your project folder—you will use one *repo* for the entire semester. For consistency, let’s name them all `harmonic-collection`.

1. In *VS Code*, make an `entry-1.html` file in the directory of the repository. You can start with this HTML:

    ```html
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Hello, world!</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>This is my first web page.</p>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Then [*commit*](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project) this file and [*push*](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/pushing-changes-to-github) your changes up to GitHub. Think of Git’s *commits* as tracked, commented, and reversible *saves*.

1. Go to your repository on [GitHub](https://github.com) (the site) and then enable [Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site), if it isn’t already. (I think it might default *on*.)

1. You should be able to see your page (after a couple minutes) live, *on the web*:

    ```html
    https://username.github.io/harmonic-collection/entry-1
    ```

## For next week



- Read the [HTML lecture](/topic/html), above. I know we breezed through this, but there is a lot there. Study it and use it as a reference, going forward.



- Complete the first entry for your [*Harmonic Collection*](/project/harmonic) projects.

  This should make (thorough) use of the basic HTML we went through today. I’m looking for you to explore, start unpacking your theme, and get your feet wet—so beyond what we did together in-class. Follow the links, watch the video, show me that *engagement*.

- When you are done, add a link to your entry into our tracking document:

  [*Harmonic Collection* entries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vXYVnicRUHnczxPCSaqsmmflynnwP22zhES5jFMPKpw/)
  {: .icon-link}

> These should always be done *before the start* of the next class. Any links added after we begin each session will be considered late, and [we don’t accept](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u358io8doX_SVVMGqIM_oH5V0OIccneYu4Ww-uE55QM/edit#heading=h.64moyiwmpq3g) late work.
