title: The box model
order: 3
---



The first thing we need to understand is how CSS sizes elements. This is called the [*the box model*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model), as¬†everything on the web begins as a¬†rectangle:
{: .left }

* [Introduction to¬†CSS layout¬†| MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Introduction) \
	*As usual.*

* [web.dev Layout](https://web.dev/learn/css/layout/) \
	*This gets into `grid` and `flex`; we‚Äôll talk about those soon.*
{: .right .no-marker .icon-link rows="2" }

{% include figure.html src='box-model.svg' caption='With `box-sizing: content-box;` per the spec.' %}

By default, browsers are set to `box-sizing: content-box;` which means that the padding (and border) exists *outside* the content width or height‚Äîso padding is then an *outset.*

But this is often unintuitive and doesn‚Äôt fit with most web design patterns, so it is very common (nearly universal) to instead set this to `box-sizing: border-box;` which makes padding and border exist *inside* the content dimensions. Then padding is easier to think of as an *inset*. ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-3/)¬†probably got this default wrong. Good ol‚Äô CSS!)

{% include figure.html src='box-model-border.svg' caption='With `box-sizing: border-box;` the defacto standard. Most [CSS¬†resets](/topic/css#resets) will do this for you! Like I¬†said, very common.' %}



Let‚Äôs take a look at this box, going inside-to-outside.



## Content



The *content area* is the guts of the element, usually text or an image. Its dimensions are defined by that content, but also can be specified directly via `width` or `height`. (More on those soon.)

{% include figure.html src='/example/content/demo' height='23rem' %}

> I‚Äôve pulled our [CSS¬†reset](/topic/css#resets) into the `<head>` all of these examples, so we are only seeing the styles that are expressly written out here.
{: .callout .two-above icon="ü§ö" }



## Padding



Next comes [*padding*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding), which extends the element‚Äôs area around the content. It‚Äôs easiest to think of this as an *inset* (if we‚Äôve made our `box-sizing` the logical `border-box`,¬†above).

{% include figure.html src='/example/padding/demo' height='28rem' %}



### A sidebar about *shorthand*

*Padding*‚Äîand many other properties, like *border* and *margin*‚Äîcan be specified with a¬†[shorthand property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties) to make it easier to use the same spacing all around, or shared top/bottom and left/right. (We‚Äôll¬†talk about units below, promise.)

- 1 value: *all directions/sides*
- 2 values: *top/bottom, left/right*
- 3 values: *top, left/right,¬†bottom*
- 4 values: *top, right, bottom,¬†left*
{: .half .two-above }

```css
p { padding: 20px; }
p { padding: 20px 40px; }
p { padding: 20px 40px 80px; }
p { padding: 20px 20px 40px 80px; }
```
{: .half }

You can always write the individual directions out, though (like `padding-top`). Three- and four-value rules are harder to read, so I¬†tend to avoid them.



## Border



Then we have [*border*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border). Border is‚Ä¶ the border around an element. It has its own `border-width`, `border-color`, and also `border-style`:

{% include figure.html src='/example/border/demo' caption='The shorthand `border-top` property value order here doesn‚Äôt matter! Isn‚Äôt CSS logical.' height='42rem' %}

{% include figure.html src='/example/border-style/demo' height='58rem' caption='Look at all those borders.' %}

{% include figure.html src='/example/border-radius/demo' height='67rem' %}



## Margin



The last part of our box is [*margin*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin)‚Äîthe space *around* an element, empty/whitespace area that is used to separate an element from its *siblings*. Like *padding* and *border*, you can specify it all around or on individual sides.

{% include figure.html src='/example/margin/demo' height='37rem' %}

Margin has a¬†couple tricks up its sleeve. First, it can have *negative* values‚Äîwhich will eat up/remove space between elements. (*Padding* and *border* only take up space.) Just add a¬†minus before the value and watch it bring things¬†together.

{% include figure.html src='/example/margin-negative/demo' caption='The first element pulls the second element closer with a¬†*negative* margin.
' height='25rem' %}

Also [margins *collapse*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing), meaning that they are sometimes combined into a¬†single value (the largest) between two elements. This happens most often on adjacent siblings, and is both useful and an absolute pain.

{% include figure.html src='/example/margin-collapse/demo' caption='You might expect the margin between the first two `div` to be¬†`80px`, but it is only `40px`. They have *collapsed.*' height='26rem' %}



## And their units



Okay, so we have all these box properties‚Äîbut how do we specify the dimensions? CSS has many [*length units*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length), used for `width`, `height`, and also  `padding`, `border`, `margin`, and even `font-size`. (Picas, anyone?) We‚Äôll look at some common ones.



### Absolute length units

Maybe the easiest ones to understand, fixed to physical (well, sort of) sizes. \
\
*With the many vagaries of screen size and density, the physical/ruler lengths will only be correct when you print. And maybe not even then.*
{: .half }

```css
.pixels {
	height: 360px;
	width: 720px;
}

.inches {
	height: 5in;
	width: 10in;
}

.mm {
	height: 84mm;
	width: 400mm;
}
```
{: .half }



### Relative length units

Otherwise you can use *relative* units, which depend on and respond to their context. \
\
*These are distinctly and intrinsically <em>web</em>¬†measurements.*
{: .half }

```css
/* Relative to nearest sized ancestor. */
.percentage {
	height: 90%;
	width: 85%;
}

/* Relative to viewport height/width. */
.viewport {
	height: 75vh;
	width: 80vw;
}

/* Relative to element font-size. */
.em {
	height: 14em; /* 1em is one line. */
	width: 4.8em;
}

/* Also relative to font size */
.ch {
	width: 1ch; /* 1ch is one letter. */
}

/* Relative to :root font-size. */
.rem {
	height: 12rem;
	width: 2.4rem;
}
```
{: .half }


### Combine them with a `calc`

Sometimes you might want to use these together! Or otherwise do some math. For this we have the [calc¬†function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc()).
{: .half }

```css
.absolute-and-relative {
	width: calc(50% - 20px);
}

.computer-do-the-math {
	width: calc(100% / 12);
}
```
{: .half }

> CSS is big and massive and overwhelming and sometimes indefensibly nonsensical‚Äîbut remember that you can do a¬†surprising amount with just these basic properties! And no matter how complex it gets, it always comes back to these¬†basics.
{: .callout icon="üò•" }



## Position



With an idea of how elements take up space, now we‚Äôll look at how they exist and move together in the [*document flow*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow). The CSS property `position` [sets this relationship](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position).



### Static

By default, every element is *static‚Äî*just meaning its normal, stacked position in the document.

*You‚Äôll rarely, if ever, actually set this yourself. It‚Äôs the default you change.*

{% include figure.html src='/example/position-static/demo' caption='Nothing changes here‚Äî`static` is the default.' height='24rem' %}



### Relative

The first thing we might want to do is adjust an element *from* that normal *static* position, which we can do with *relative* positioning.

Once you have set `position: relative;` you can use the  `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` values (with any of the units, above) to move the element away from its default, normal position in the flow.

{% include figure.html src='/example/position-relative/demo' caption='The element still exists/takes up space in the *flow*.' height='30rem' %}



### Absolute

*Absolute* positioning is somewhat similar to *relative‚Äî*but instead of placing an element in relation to its own default position, it uses the position of its nearest *relatively-positioned* ancestor. So it will ‚Äúgo up the chain‚Äù of parents and wrapper elements until it finds one set to `position: relative;`, then uses the same offset properties to move the element around.

Importantly, `position: absolute;` also *removes* the element from the normal document flow‚Äîmeaning it takes up no space in the page layout.

*This is often used for exacting, specific design elements.*

{% include figure.html src='/example/position-absolute/demo' caption='The element is out of the *flow*, and placed according to the `relative` parent.' height='35rem' %}



### Fixed

*Fixed* positioning also removes the element from the document flow, but it places elements with relation to the *browser viewport*‚Äîthe boundaries of the window or device.

So `position: fixed;` brings the element completely out of the page‚Äôs normal flow, like it is sitting on its own separate layer.

*This is often used for things like navigation elements.*

{% include figure.html src='/example/position-fixed/demo' height="29rem" %}



### Sticky

The most recent addition to the *position* party, `position: sticky;` elements are placed according to the normal flow of the document, like *static,* until their nearest *scrolling ancestor* (usually the viewport) moves past them. The element is then *stuck* in relation to this element.

*This is often used for headers on tables and lists.*

{% include figure.html src='/example/position-sticky/demo' caption='This always feels very *web*-y.' height='29rem' %}



### ‚ÄúDepth‚Äù

Okay, [*z-index*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index) is not strictly *positioning*‚Äîit is a¬†separate property. You can see that all these *position* properties have given us ways to make things overlap. `z-index` is how we can decide the *front-to-back* ordering (think [*z-axis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#Three_dimensions)).

By default, items that are lower in the DOM (coming after each other) are in front of higher, earlier elements.

{% include figure.html src='/example/z-index/demo' caption='The two `position` properties both create new stacking contexts, `z-index: 1;` moves even elements in front.' height='38rem' %}

A whole lot of things make a¬†new [*stacking context*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context) (including most `position` changes) which is kind of like a¬†*group* that has its own internal depth/overlap order. No amount of internal *z-index* adjustments can break something out of that group‚Äîwhich is one of the reasons why *z* can be really difficult to understand and tricky to use. But you can adjust the *z-index* of the group, as we do here.



## Floats



Sometimes you‚Äôll want to have an image or block flow within a¬†block of text. There are a¬†lot of ways to do this now, but the oldest (yet sometimes still trickiest) is a¬†[*float*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Floats).



### Left and right

The declarations `float: left;` and `float: right;` take an element out of the normal flow and place it on the left or right side of its parent container. Any text *siblings* will then flow around the element‚Äîlike a¬†*text wrap‚Äî*filling up any available space to its side. They will go as far up as the top of the *floated element*.

{% include figure.html src='/example/float/demo' height='40rem' %}



### Don‚Äôt forget to `clear`

Since this takes the floated element out of the *flow*, if we want the following element (often another text block, like a¬†`<p>`) to not move up it needs to be *cleared* with `clear: left;` , `clear: right;`, or `clear: both;`. Applied on the following element, it will make it stay entirely below (clear of) the *floated* element.

{% include figure.html src='/example/float-clear/demo' caption='Uh oh, classic *float* problem on the second one.' height='48rem' %}

If you have a¬†parent wrapper and no following element, there won‚Äôt be anything there to *clear* the float‚Äîmeaning the parent will collapse down to the size of the text content. You can solve this broken look with a¬†*[clearfix hack](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clear#sect1)*, which uses a¬†pseudo-element as an ersatz `last-child` to clear the container.

{% include figure.html src='/example/float-clearfix/demo' caption='Much better. `:after` is a¬†pseudo-element‚Äîwhich acts here as a¬†last child that clears the `div`.' height='52rem' %}



Generally, I¬†try and avoid floats‚Äîthey aren‚Äôt common in modern design patterns and have been giving people headaches for‚Ä¶ *decades* now. They require you to know how long your content is and also how big your viewport/page will be‚Äîboth things that you don‚Äôt always have control over in responsive/mobile 2022.

*Sometimes they are still the only thing that can do what you need!*



## Display



In our [HTML introduction](/topic/html#block-elements) we briefly talked about *block* and *inline* elements, as set by the user-agent styles. These are the first two examples of [the *display* property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display).



### Block

So as we discussed, most HTML elements are *block-level* by default. But you can also set `display: block;` manually on an *inline* element, too. This would mean that it starts on a¬†new line, takes up the full width available, and you can specify a¬†`height`, `width`, and use `margin` above and below.

{% include figure.html src='/example/display-block/demo' caption='Whenever you are linking a¬†whole area (like an image and text together), safe bet that you want `block`.' height='36rem' %}



### Inline

And going the other way, you can make *block* elements switch to *inline* with `display: inline;`. They will no longer start on their own lines, will only take up as much space as their content/children, and don‚Äôt accept `height` and `width` properties.

{% include figure.html src='/example/display-inline/demo' caption='The `white-space` property `pre`-vents the spaces in the paragraphs from collapsing.' height='32rem' %}



### ‚Ä¶but also `inline-block`

You can also combine the qualities of *block* and *inline* with `display: inline-block;`. These elements take `height` and `width` (and vertical `margin`) like *block-level* elements, but do not start on their own line.

{% include figure.html src='/example/display-inline-block/demo' height='40rem' %}



### And sometimes `none`

Setting `display: none;` hides an element visually from the document‚Äîas well as taking it out of the *flow*. (Keep in mind the HTML is still there, if someone opens up the source¬†code.)

This is a¬†common way to hide/show (by setting another *display* property) elements on the page, but it will *reflow* the document when applied‚Äîas if the element is actually added/removed from the DOM.

{% include figure.html src='/example/display-none/demo' caption='Poof. Like it wasn‚Äôt even there.' height='17rem' %}



### ‚Ä¶vs. Visibility?

You can also hide something [visually](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/visibility) without taking it out of the document *flow,* which is useful when you don‚Äôt want the page to jump/*reflow* when something appears/disappears. Setting `visibility: hidden;` keeps the space an element had before, but makes it invisible and unable to be interacted with. The value `visible` is the default.

{% include figure.html src='/example/visibility/demo' height='22rem' %}



### ‚Ä¶vs. Opacity?

Another way to hide an element visually is to adjust [its opacity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity), which uses values on a¬†scale from¬†0‚Äì1. This differs from `visibility` because elements with no (or partial) opacity can still be interacted¬†with.

{% include figure.html src='/example/opacity/demo' caption='You can still select the text (or click links) of not-fully-opaque elements.' height='22rem' %}

Keep in mind that `display: none;`, `visibility: hidden;`, and `opacity: 0;` only hide things in the rendered browser view. The HTML is still visible in the source¬†code!



### ‚Ä¶ `flex` and `grid`?

We‚Äôll cover these separately! But they‚Äôll make your (layout) life¬†easier.
