## Reading discussion

Let’s start by discussing our reading:

[*A Software Design Manifesto* responses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nTweY_mL9g7GXOI8x56TfnTDz0b847qeIj0Hroil_QA)

*Don’t make me call on you! I don’t want to do it either.*

## For next week

- Go through our Jekyll demo/exercise and the [example repo](https://github.com/core-interaction/harmonic-collection)—getting it building on your machine. Kick the tires, as they say.

	Then consider using it for your projects! It will be some work to adapt (in software parlance, to *port* or *refactor*) your projects to this, but obviously will be easier to write structured, repeated HTML.

- Complete a seventh entry for your [*Harmonic Collection*](/project/harmonic) projects and add it to the doc, as is custom:
