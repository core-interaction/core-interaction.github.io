## Midterm presentations



We’ll be spending our class today going through your [*Harmonic Collection* projects](project/harmonic/).

A reminder on format: each student will have about 5 minutes to present their work. In this time, talk us through your topic and explain how you wanted to explore it through your entries. Then show us your pages (on mobile and desktop), taking us through each one—but stay focused on the *whole*. You can also explain what your challenges were, and how you’d improve on the execution with additional time or more experience.
{: .two-above }

And per our [community agreement](/syllabus/#our-class-policies) (and courtesy), the presenting student “has the floor.” Everyone else should close their laptops and turn off their phones—and nobody should <nobr>come-and-go</nobr> from the room during a presentation. (Disruptions will count against the offender.)



Here’s the order we’ll be going through:

## For next week



- Complete the next (sixth) entry for your [*Harmonic Collection*](project/harmonic/).

  Take this as an opportunity to again think about your project as a *system*. You will ultimately have 11 entries—and you don’t want to be grasping for things at the end of the semester. You could treat the midterm as a chapter-marker, or continue with your current progression.

  When you’re done, add a link to your sixth entry:

  [*Harmonic Collection* entries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vXYVnicRUHnczxPCSaqsmmflynnwP22zhES5jFMPKpw/)
  {: .icon-link}



- I know all this manual/repetitive/copy-paste HTML writing is a pain! So we’re going to try using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which is CMS (content management system) software that we’ll use for templating. We’ll go into more depth next week, but I want you to start by having it installed on your machines so we can hit the ground running:

  * [Jekyll on Mac OS](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/) \
	*Instructions for Macs.*

  * [Jekyll on Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/) \
	*And our Windows friends.*

  * [Install Jekll on Apple Silicon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKB9ylw0G4U) \
  *A pretty thorough video of a guy setting it up and getting a basic site going.*
  {: .icon-link .no-marker }

- This is going to be technical, probably somewhat tedious, and involve a CLI (command-line interface)! It often goes wrong for some arcane reason. But it’ll make your (HTML) lives much easier, I promise. Google, help each other, talk to the [Code Tutors](https://cdparsons.glideapp.io/dl/6471c6/s/d528aa/r/6AxSg3iKke0XTeKwgYFp), and work your way through it.

  For next week, when you type `jekyll -v` into your terminal you should see `jekyll 4.2.2`! Have it installed and [building an empty site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) by next class.
