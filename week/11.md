## For next week

- Go over the [JavaScript intro](/topic/javascript), above! And start adding some basic interaction to your projects.

- Complete your ninth [*HarmonicÂ Collection*](/project/harmonic) entry and add it to the doc:

	[*Harmonic Collection* entries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vXYVnicRUHnczxPCSaqsmmflynnwP22zhES5jFMPKpw/)
	{: .icon-link}

- Think about topics for our question/answer sessions!

	This could be technical topicsâ€”either ones we want to revisit or new things we havenâ€™t covered yet. This could also just be conversation subjectsâ€”general questions you have about the field, working as aÂ designer, NFTs, anything you want. You know I can gab; pick myÂ brain!

	Iâ€™ve started aÂ Google Doc for us to compile these:
