Let’s talk through our reading:

## Let’s write some code!

We’re going to dive right in and make our first web pages, no big deal! We’ll do this together.

* You’ll need to download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), which we’ll use as our text editor for the course.

  You’ll also hear me refer to this as an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), for *Integrated Development Environment*. Think of this as a fancy text editor with coding-specific features, like syntax highlighting and tabs. There are many of them! *VS Code* is probably the most popular, right now.

* Also download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), which we’ll use to manage our code.

  [Git](https://git-scm.com) is version control software, which tracks changes and helps developers work together. [Git*Hub*](https://github.com) is a widely-used, web-based host for Git projects—known as *repositories*. You can do this all via the command line (and even right from VS Code), but I think we’ll use their *Desktop* app for now.

## For next week



- Complete the first entry for your [*Harmonic Collection*](/project/harmonic) projects. This should make (thorough) use of the basic HTML we went through today. I’m looking for you to explore and get your feet wet.

- When you are done, add a link to your entry into our tracking document:

  [*Harmonic Collection* entries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vXYVnicRUHnczxPCSaqsmmflynnwP22zhES5jFMPKpw/)
  {: .icon-link}

> These should always be done *before the start* of the next class. Any links added after we begin each session will be considered late, and [we don’t accept](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u358io8doX_SVVMGqIM_oH5V0OIccneYu4Ww-uE55QM/edit#heading=h.64moyiwmpq3g) late work.
