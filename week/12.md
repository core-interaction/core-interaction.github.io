## Update on the strike



So I know there has been a lot of… let’s say *mixed* communication around this and where things are at. I’ll tell you what I know.

Our union contract expired on Sunday evening, and our members [voted *overwhelmingly*](https://www.youarethenewschool.com/bargaining-blog/strike-vote-97-yes) to authorize a strike. Our bargaining committee has given the school a deadline of today to make substantive progress towards [our proposals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WHLI69QzIsa12KfYM99eq6CdnwhwOx0qDE-wOhMWZGw), which they (so far) have not done.

We might even know by our class time, if they have—but if they haven’t, a strike will begin tomorrow (Wednesday, 11/16).



What will that look like, for us?
{: .two-above }

- Class tonight might be a little weird! But let’s talk about it and how you are feeling; I recognize the uncertainty and its presence looming over us.

- If we are still on strike next week (11/22), I will not be teaching class—neither in-person or remote. Same goes for any weeks after that, as long as we are on strike.

- I will not be available for any (course-related) communication—in Slack, Zoom, Canvas, email—again, as long as we are on strike. It is even possible I will no longer have access to these tools.

- I will not be reviewing your assignments (project entries) or offering any help/feedback—but you can continue with them. I hope we will still be able to review your final presentations, together, on December 6.

- This will not negatively impact your grades, credits, graduation, visas, or scholarships. As much as this is up to me, with regards to this class, you will not be penalized in any way for this strike.

- I will be on the picket line! (Likely right around/before our class times.) And you are welcome to join me and your other instructors.

Know that I don’t like any of this, either. I would prefer not to go on strike, and I know that this sentiment is shared strongly by my colleagues (your other instructors). But our *teaching conditions* are your *learning conditions*—and we don’t think they are sustainable, as it stands.

I am hoping that we are all back together, soon.
