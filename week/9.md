## Reading discussion

Letâ€™s start by discussing our reading:

[*A Software Design Manifesto* responses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nTweY_mL9g7GXOI8x56TfnTDz0b847qeIj0Hroil_QA)

*Donâ€™t make me call on youâ€”I donâ€™t want to do it either! Weâ€™ll skip reviewing our entries as a group this week, to get into new content.*



## Jekyll, Liquid, and Markdown!

Weâ€™ll discuss aÂ few systems for working more easily with HTML (IÂ hope):

> Back to our standard mid-lecture break somewhere in here, as we do.

## Letâ€™s try it out

Weâ€™ll be using the [template repo](https://github.com/core-interaction/harmonic-collection) to explore Jekyll/Liquid/Markdown together. Hereâ€™s a little agenda:

- What is a `README.md`?
- How about `.gitignore`?
- Quickly, *the terminal*
- Build with `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`
- Go through `_config.yml` settings
- *Front-matter* to specify a layout, variables
- Nesting of layouts (for entries)
- `include` and entry-specific CSS (first entry)
- Markdown parsing (second entry, turn off reset)
- Structured data (third entry, show `for` loop)
- Add an entry, if we have time

## For next week

- Go through our Jekyll demo/exercise and the [template repo](https://github.com/core-interaction/harmonic-collection), getting it building on your machine. Kick the tires, as they say.

	Then consider using it for your projects! It will be some work to adapt (in software parlance, to *port* or *refactor*) your projects to this, but obviously will be easier to write structured, repeated HTML.

- Complete a seventh entry for your [*HarmonicÂ Collection*](/project/harmonic) projects and add it to the doc, as is custom:
