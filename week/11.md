## Strike stuff

If folks would like more information about the possibility of aÂ PTFÂ strike (and what that might actually look like), there is aÂ [*Strike School for Students*](https://www.youarethenewschool.com/strikeschool) this Thursday, NovemberÂ 10, 3â€“4:30pm inÂ theÂ Eugene Lang Courtyard. Iâ€™m told there will beÂ bagels!

*Iâ€™ll be getting more info onÂ Wednesday. Hereâ€™s [the info flier](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6338ea3a7bfbe77eb6ccd895/t/63651ba2107f48291d2328bc/1667570594923/Tabling+Flier+for+Students.pdf) youÂ might have seen aroundÂ campus.*

## Simplified Jekyll

If we have time, I prepped aÂ simplified/pared-down [Jekyll](/topic/jekyll-liquid-markdown) template you could use for yourÂ projects:

[harmonic-collection-empty](https://github.com/core-interaction/harmonic-collection-empty)
{: .icon-link }

## For next week

- Go over the [JavaScript intro](/topic/javascript), above! And start adding some basic interaction to your projects.

- Complete your ninth [*HarmonicÂ Collection*](/project/harmonic) entry and add it to the doc:

	[*Harmonic Collection* entries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vXYVnicRUHnczxPCSaqsmmflynnwP22zhES5jFMPKpw/)
	{: .icon-link}

- Think about topics for our question/answer sessions!

	This could be technical topicsâ€”either ones we want to revisit or new things we havenâ€™t covered yet. This could also just be conversation subjectsâ€”general questions you have about the field, working as aÂ designer, NFTs, anything you want. You know I can gab; pick myÂ brain!

	Iâ€™ve started aÂ Google Doc for us to compile these:
