	{: .link-only }

* Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you don’t have one! Do this with your *newschool.edu* email, then apply for the [student benefits](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/student_application).
You may use this GitHub account in your career, and you can always change your username (and add other email addresses) later. We’ll be using GitHub for our code.

* Before we get into code, we’re going to read about it:

	[*What Is Code?*](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/) \
	Paul Ford
	{: .link-only}

	This is definitely *Not Short*, so please leave yourself enough time to get all the way through it. And then add your responses—which we will discuss, as a group, next class:

	[*What Is Code?* responses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pPUc6JMTWjfZCXcbxsfQw14LnelLKgyddkCBojU8Tm4/edit)

* Finally, come to class with *three* thematic ideas for your [*Harmonic Collection*](/project/harmonic) projects. We’ll be starting on them next week.
