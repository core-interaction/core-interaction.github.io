## Midterm presentations



We’ll be spending our class today going through your [*Harmonic Collection* projects](project/harmonic/).

A reminder on format: each student will have about 5 minutes to present their work. In this time, talk us through your topic and explain how you wanted to explore it through your entries. Then show us your pages (on mobile and desktop), taking us through each one—but stay focused on the *whole*. You can also explain what your challenges were, and how you’d improve on the execution with additional time or more experience.

And per our [community agreement](/syllabus/#our-class-policies) (and courtesy), the presenting student “has the floor.” Everyone else should close their laptops and turn off their phones—and nobody should <nobr>come-and-go</nobr> from the room during a presentation. (Disruptions will count against the offender.)



Here’s the order we’ll be going through:
