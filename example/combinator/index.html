			<h1>Combinators are handy</h1>
			<p>This paragraph should be <em>blue</em>, since it is inside the header.</p>
		</header>
		<p>This paragraph should be <em>gray</em>, as an immediate child of <strong>body</strong>.</p>
		<p>This one should be <em>teal</em> though, as it follows another paragraph.</p>
		<p>Same for this one.</p>
		<h2>This heading doesn’t have a style itself</h2>
		<p>But will make this following paragraph <em>green</em>.</p>
		<p>And this one too, since it is still after the heading.</p>
