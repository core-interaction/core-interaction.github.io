## {{ 'Course description' | kerning }}



*Typography and Interaction* is a year-long course, divided into two classes, which will provide a rigorous foundation of typographic and interaction principles in the context of digital design. This first semester will focus on a mastery of type and layout concepts, with the second semester emphasizing interaction and interface design principles. Over both, students will acquire and hone the skills necessary in the field of interactive design.

Typography is the infrastructure of communication in nearly any visual medium. It provides the very first shape and form to written content, and as designers, it is our responsibility to do this with intention and care. Whether towards goals of expression itself or in the service of ideas, the designer must understand type to use it successfully. In this way, we are stewards of meaning.

Digital design, the web in particular, is inextricably linked with typography—from the very letters of code at its base to the words in arrangement we see on a screen. Type, thus, is the scaffolding in which all interaction design first rises. The very shape of the web, in its layouts, grid systems, and patterns—and its various technologies—all exist in the service of type, at their root. They provide the tools with which we can breathe a form and different, digital life into that meaning.

In this course, students will learn intermediate and advanced methods in typography and layout as they concern interactive design. We will use web technologies as the lens to examine this subject—introducing the foundational, front-end languages of HTML and CSS to achieve our designs. Students will understand the specific challenges of type in this medium, but also how it offers unique and particular forms to us as designers. They will learn the common tools and paradigms with which we practice, while developing their own visual, design vocabulary and critical understanding.



## {{ 'Learning outcomes' | kerning }}



By the end of this semester, students will:

* Demonstrate advanced knowledge of and be able to critically analyze type, form, and interactivity as it applies to screen-based media.

* Understand how to effectively deploy type hierarchy in layout and grid systems, in responsive, device-agnostic design.

* Effectively translate these designs into functional websites using HTML, CSS and other web technologies.

* Design and prototype work while taking into account the ever-shifting, bespoke challenges of web design.

* Give, receive, and respond productively to feedback in critiques.

* Think critically and develop their own, developed thoughts on the role of digital within the larger canon of design.

### {{ 'Unit tasks' | kerning }}
{: .two-below}

* #### Readings and reviews

	Each unit begins with a set of readings to introduce the subject. Students are expected to read the required selections and synthesize their thoughts in a written response, prior to the next class. We will then discuss these responses.

* #### Exercises and demos

	Each unit will also have technical exercises and demos that are assigned to provide additional understanding of topics. Students are expected to complete these outside of class, before the next session.

* #### Critiques

	Each unit will conclude with a review of its project. In addition to the project itself, students will be assessed on their presentation of their work, as well as their ability to provide constructive, critical feedback to their peers.



### {{ 'Projects' | kerning }}



The bulk of the work for this class is divided into three projects. They  are intended as opportunities for students to apply knowledge and skills learned in class, while developing their own practice. There will be check-ins and presentations around each of these before the final due dates, when we will have critiques as a group:
{: .two-below}

* #### Project 1: *Manuscript*

	Students will choose a seminal design text from readings.design, read and respond to it, and typeset their selection and reply together as a web page. Other texts are also allowed on a case-by-case basis.

	*We’ll be looking for the quality of responses, appropriate type selection and hierarchy, semantic HTML, and basic CSS.*

	*Due September 28.*

* #### Project 2: Spread

	Students will work in pairs, with a new text from those selected by the class in *Manuscript*. Each duo will sketch collaboratively and then implement a new expression together, via pair programming. The final web page will be responsive for mobile, desktop, and print layouts.

	*Here we’re looking for successful design and development collaboration, box-model layout design, and use of responsive media queries.*

	*Due October 26.*

* #### Project 3: *Binding*

	Students will assemble a collection of texts from Spread, combined with their original selection, into a “book”. The book will be a multi-page website with a homepage (cover), navigation (table of contents), individual pages for each text, and an introduction (colophon)—with consistent styles applied across all pages.

	*We want to see effective multi-page design and navigation, advanced layouts (flexbox, grid), consistency across the pages and content, and polish/nuance.*

	*Due November 23.*
